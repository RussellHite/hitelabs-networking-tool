# Hite Labs Networking Follow-Up Tool

AI-powered networking tool that captures business cards, records conversation notes, and generates personalized follow-up emails.

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd hitelabs-networking-tool

## Prerequisites

Before deploying, ensure you have:

1. **Claude API Key** from Anthropic (https://console.anthropic.com/)
2. **Webflow API Token** with CMS access
3. **Webflow Collections** set up:
   - "App Settings" collection with email template
   - "Networking Contacts" collection for storing contacts

## Webflow Collection Setup

### App Settings Collection

Create a collection named "App Settings" with these fields:

- `email-subject-template` (Plain Text)
- `email-body-template` (Rich Text or Plain Text)
- `calendly-url` (Link)
- `signature` (Rich Text or Plain Text)

Create one item in this collection with your template. Use these placeholders:
- `{name}` - Contact's name
- `{company}` - Contact's company
- `{event}` - Event name
- `{notes_summary}` - AI-generated summary of conversation
- `{calendly_url}` - Your Calendly link
- `{signature}` - Your email signature

**Example template:**
```
Subject: Great meeting you at {event}

Body:
Hi {name},

It was great meeting you at {event}! I really enjoyed our conversation about {notes_summary}.

At Hite Labs, I help businesses like {company} turn operational chaos into smooth workflows through custom applications and process optimization. Based on what you shared, I think there could be a great fit.

I'd love to continue the conversation - here's my calendar link: {calendly_url}

Looking forward to connecting,
{signature}
```

### Networking Contacts Collection

Create a collection named "Networking Contacts" with these fields:

- `contact-name` (Plain Text)
- `email` (Email)
- `company` (Plain Text)
- `phone` (Phone)
- `linkedin-url` (Link)
- `event-name` (Plain Text)
- `voice-notes` (Rich Text)
- `generated-email` (Rich Text)
- `email-subject` (Plain Text)
- `status` (Plain Text) - Options: "Sent", "Pending", "Follow-up"
- `card-image-front` (Image) - Optional
- `card-image-back` (Image) - Optional

## Installation & Deployment

### Step 1: Get API Keys

1. **Claude API Key**:
   - Go to https://console.anthropic.com/
   - Create an account or sign in
   - Navigate to API Keys
   - Create a new key and copy it

2. **Webflow API Token**:
   - Go to Webflow Account Settings ‚Üí Integrations
   - Generate a new API token
   - Give it CMS read/write permissions
   - Copy the token

3. **Collection IDs**:
   - In Webflow Designer, go to CMS
   - Click on "App Settings" collection
   - Copy the Collection ID from the URL
   - Repeat for "Networking Contacts" collection

### Step 2: Configure Environment Variables

1. **Copy the environment template**:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

2. **Edit `.env` file** and add your real API keys:
   ```bash
   CLAUDE_API_KEY=sk-ant-api03-YOUR_ACTUAL_KEY_HERE
   WEBFLOW_API_TOKEN=YOUR_WEBFLOW_TOKEN_HERE
   WEBFLOW_SETTINGS_COLLECTION_ID=YOUR_SETTINGS_COLLECTION_ID
   WEBFLOW_CONTACTS_COLLECTION_ID=YOUR_CONTACTS_COLLECTION_ID
   ```

   ‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT**: Never commit the `.env` file to Git! It's already in `.gitignore`.

### Step 3: Build Production File

1. **Install dependencies** (one-time setup):
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Build the production HTML**:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

   This creates `index-production.html` with your API keys injected.

3. **Verify the build**:
   - Check for `index-production.html` in your project folder
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è This file contains real API keys - never commit it to Git!

### Step 4: Deploy to Webflow

#### Option A: Custom Code Embed (Recommended)

1. In Webflow Designer, create a new page (e.g., "/networking-contacts")
2. Add a **Custom Code** embed element to the page
3. Open `index-production.html` and copy **everything** from `<!DOCTYPE html>` to `</html>`
4. Paste into the Custom Code element
5. Publish your site

**Note**: Always use `index-production.html` (with real keys), not `index.html` (with placeholders)!

#### Option B: External Hosting

1. Upload `index-production.html` to your web server (rename to `index.html`)
2. Ensure it's served over HTTPS
3. In Webflow, create an Embed element with an iframe:
```html
<iframe src="https://your-domain.com/networking-tool/index.html"
        style="width: 100%; height: 100vh; border: none;"
        allow="camera; microphone">
</iframe>
```

### Step 5: Test the Application

1. Open the page on your mobile device
2. Test each section:
   - ‚úÖ Take a photo of a business card
   - ‚úÖ Verify AI extracts contact information
   - ‚úÖ Enter event name
   - ‚úÖ Record or type conversation notes
   - ‚úÖ Generate email and review
   - ‚úÖ Click "Open in Email App" (should open email client)
   - ‚úÖ Check Webflow CMS for saved contact

## Usage

### At a Networking Event

1. **Capture**: Take a photo of the business card (front and optionally back)
2. **Review**: AI automatically extracts contact info - edit if needed
3. **Event**: Select or type the event name
4. **Notes**: Record or type key conversation points
5. **Generate**: AI creates a personalized follow-up email
6. **Send**: Review, edit if needed, then open in your email app
7. **Next**: Click "Add Another Contact" to process the next person

### Tips for Best Results

- **Good Lighting**: Take card photos in well-lit areas
- **Centered Cards**: Keep the business card centered in frame
- **Clear Notes**: Be specific in conversation notes for better AI summaries
- **Edit Before Sending**: Always review the AI-generated email
- **Event Names**: Reuse event names for quick selection

## Troubleshooting

### Camera doesn't open
- Check browser permissions (Settings ‚Üí Privacy ‚Üí Camera)
- Ensure you're on HTTPS (required for camera access)
- Try a different browser

### AI extraction returns empty fields
- Retake the photo with better lighting
- Ensure the card text is clearly visible
- Manually enter the information as fallback

### Email doesn't open in client
- The mailto: link should work on most devices
- If URL is too long, try shortening your notes
- Use the clipboard fallback if prompted

### Webflow save fails
- Verify API token has CMS permissions
- Check collection IDs are correct
- Ensure all field names match exactly
- Contact will still be emailed even if save fails

### Template not loading
- Verify "App Settings" collection has at least one item
- Check API token permissions
- App will use hardcoded fallback if fetch fails

## Security Considerations

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: API keys are embedded in client-side code and visible to users.

**For Production:**
- Consider using a proxy server to hide API keys
- Set up billing alerts on Claude API
- Monitor usage regularly
- Limit Webflow token permissions to minimum required
- Rotate API keys quarterly

**Data Privacy:**
- All data is stored in your Webflow CMS
- No third-party tracking
- Images stored on Webflow CDN
- Complies with standard web privacy practices

## Browser Compatibility

**Primary Support:**
- iOS Safari 14+
- Android Chrome 90+

**Secondary Support:**
- Desktop Chrome
- Desktop Safari
- Desktop Firefox

**Known Limitations:**
- Voice recording may not work on older browsers
- mailto: behavior varies by device
- Some Android devices may limit image size

## Performance Targets

- **Page Load**: < 3 seconds on 3G
- **Image Compression**: < 2MB per image
- **AI Extraction**: 3-5 seconds average
- **Email Generation**: 5-10 seconds average
- **Total Time per Contact**: 60-90 seconds

## Development

### Local Testing

1. Open `index.html` in a browser
2. Note: Camera and some features require HTTPS
3. Use `python -m http.server 8000 --bind localhost` for local HTTPS testing
4. Or use browser's device emulation mode

### Making Changes

1. Edit `index.html` directly
2. Test locally
3. Replace configuration placeholders
4. Deploy to Webflow
5. Test on actual mobile devices

### Code Structure

The entire application is contained in a single HTML file with three main sections:

- **Styles** (lines 7-295): All CSS for responsive layout
